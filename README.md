# Data-Analysis-Udacity

<h1> Project: The Movie Database (TMDb)</h1> This is the dataset that I have decided to investigate )
I would like to know if the budget affect also the amount of revenues. In other words is there a correlation between the budget and the revenues per film.

Some of the questions that I am trying to answer:
<li> 
<ul> Does the popularity of a movie affect the revenue? Is a higher budget associated with higher popularity?</ul>
    <ul> Is the number of movies released per year increased or decreased? </ul>
    <ul>What is the correlation between the different variables in our dataset? </ul>
    <ul>Do the average revenue increase or decrease during the years? </ul>
    <ul>How is the distribution of avergae vote for our movies? </ul></li>
